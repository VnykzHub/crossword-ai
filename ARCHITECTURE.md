# Crossword AI - Technical Architecture

This document describes the technical architecture and design decisions for the AI Powered Crossword Puzzles application.

## System Overview

The application is built using a modern client-server architecture:

1. **Frontend**: React-based single-page application (SPA)
2. **Backend**: FastAPI Python service that connects to Azure OpenAI

## Component Architecture

### Backend Components

#### 1. FastAPI Application (`main.py`)
- Entry point for the application
- Defines REST API endpoints
- Handles HTTP requests/responses
- Manages CORS and middleware configuration

#### 2. Crossword Generation Service
- Core logic for generating crossword puzzles
- Prompts Azure OpenAI to create themed word lists with clues
- Implements crossword grid layout algorithm

#### 3. External Services Integration
- Support for both Azure OpenAI API and standard OpenAI API
- Flexible environment-based configuration management
- Dynamic model selection based on API type

### Frontend Components

#### 1. React Application (`App.js`)
- Main container component
- Manages application state
- Handles user interaction

#### 2. Crossword Grid Component
- Renders the interactive crossword puzzle
- Manages cell selection and input
- Provides visual feedback for correct/incorrect answers

#### 3. Game Control Components
- Theme input and grid size selection
- New game generation
- Score and timer tracking

#### 4. Clue Management Components
- Displays across/down clues
- Highlights active clues
- Tracks completed words

## Data Flow

1. **Puzzle Generation**
   - User enters optional theme and selects grid size
   - Frontend sends request to backend API
   - Backend prompts Azure OpenAI with specialized instruction set
   - LLM generates themed word list with clues
   - Backend algorithm arranges words in crossword grid format
   - Complete puzzle (grid, placements, clues) sent to frontend

2. **User Interaction**
   - User selects cells and types letters
   - Frontend validates input against solution
   - UI updates with visual feedback
   - Score and completion status tracked locally

## Technical Decisions

### Backend Technology Choices

- **FastAPI**: Modern, high-performance Python web framework with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **Azure OpenAI**: Enterprise-grade LLM API with robust prompt engineering capabilities
- **Python**: Excellent for AI/ML integration and rapid development

### Frontend Technology Choices

- **React**: Component-based UI library for building interactive interfaces
- **CSS3**: Custom styling for responsive design
- **JavaScript ES6+**: Modern language features for cleaner code

### Key Algorithms

1. **Word Placement Algorithm**
   - Places longer words first to maximize grid density
   - Prioritizes word intersections for challenging gameplay
   - Ensures all words connect properly in the grid

2. **User Input Validation**
   - Real-time feedback on correct/incorrect letters
   - Word completion tracking
   - Score calculation based on correct/incorrect answers

## Development and Deployment

### Development Environment
- Local development with hot-reloading
- Environment variable configuration for API credentials

### Deployment Options
- Backend: Any Python-compatible hosting (AWS, Azure, Heroku)
- Frontend: Static hosting services (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)

## Future Architecture Extensions

1. **Database Integration**
   - User accounts and authentication
   - Puzzle history and leaderboards
   - Daily challenge management

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Caching for generated puzzles
   - Optimized grid generation algorithm
   - Pre-loading common themes

3. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Responsive design for various screen sizes
   - Touch interaction improvements
   - PWA capabilities
